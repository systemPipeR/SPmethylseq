  abstract = "Improving the responsiveness, acclimation, and memory of plants
              to abiotic stress holds substantive potential for improving
              agriculture. An unresolved question is the involvement of
              chromatin marks in the memory of agriculturally relevant
              stresses. Such potential has spurred numerous investigations
              yielding both promising and conflicting results. Consequently, it
              remains unclear to what extent robust stress-induced DNA
              methylation variation can underpin stress memory. Using a
              slow-onset water deprivation treatment in Arabidopsis
              (Arabidopsis thaliana), we investigated the malleability of the
              DNA methylome to drought stress within a generation and under
              repeated drought stress over five successive generations. While
              drought-associated epi-alleles in the methylome were detected
              within a generation, they did not correlate with
              drought-responsive gene expression. Six traits were analyzed for
              transgenerational stress memory, and the descendants of
              drought-stressed lineages showed one case of memory in the form
              of increased seed dormancy, and that persisted one generation
              removed from stress. With respect to transgenerational drought
              stress, there were negligible conserved differentially methylated
              regions in drought-exposed lineages compared with unstressed
              lineages. Instead, the majority of observed variation was tied to
              stochastic or preexisting differences in the epigenome occurring
              at repetitive regions of the Arabidopsis genome. Furthermore, the
              experience of repeated drought stress was not observed to
              influence transgenerational epi-allele accumulation. Our findings
              demonstrate that, while transgenerational memory is observed in
              one of six traits examined, they are not associated with
              causative changes in the DNA methylome, which appears relatively
              impervious to drought stress.",

              be easily obtained (e.g. multi-sample low-coverage sequencing or

              development of new methods for analyzing sequence data with

              calling SNPs, discovering somatic mutations, inferring population

              based on sequencing data without explicit genotyping or

              mutations and confirm that for discovering rare events,
              mismapping is frequently the leading source of errors.

              important roles in many biological processes and diseases.
              Bisulfite sequencing (BS-seq) has emerged recently as the
              technology of choice to profile DNA methylation because of its
              accuracy, genome coverage and higher resolution. Current
              statistical methods to identify differential methylation mainly
              focus on comparing two treatment groups. With an increasing
              number of experiments performed under a general and
              multiple-factor design, particularly in reduced representation
              bisulfite sequencing, there is a need to develop more flexible,
              powerful and computationally efficient methods. RESULTS: We
              present a novel statistical model to detect differentially
              methylated loci from BS-seq data under general experimental
              design, based on a beta-binomial regression model with 'arcsine'

  abstract = "DNA methylation is an important epigenetic modification that has
              essential roles in cellular processes including gene regulation,
              development and disease and is widely dysregulated in most types
              of cancer. Recent advances in sequencing technology have enabled
              the measurement of DNA methylation at single nucleotide
              resolution through methods such as whole-genome bisulfite
              sequencing and reduced representation bisulfite sequencing. In
              DNA methylation studies, a key task is to identify differences
              under distinct biological contexts, for example, between tumor
              and normal tissue. A challenge in sequencing studies is that the
              number of biological replicates is often limited by the costs of
              sequencing. The small number of replicates leads to unstable
              variance estimation, which can reduce accuracy to detect
              differentially methylated loci (DML). Here we propose a novel
              statistical method to detect DML when comparing two treatment
              groups. The sequencing counts are described by a
              lognormal-beta-binomial hierarchical model, which provides a
              basis for information sharing across different CpG sites. A Wald
              test is developed for hypothesis testing at each CpG site.
              Simulation results show that the proposed method yields improved
              DML detection compared to existing methods, particularly when the
              number of replicates is low. The proposed method is implemented
